Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The top section of the dashboard highlights the main KPIs, providing a high-level summary of the business's performance.

Sum of Amount (438K): The total revenue generated from all sales. This is a primary metric for overall business health.

Sum of Quantity (5615): The total number of items sold. This helps in understanding sales volume.

Sum of Profit (37K): The total profit earned after deducting costs from revenue. This is a critical metric for profitability analysis.

Sum of AOV (121K): The total average order value, which is the average amount spent per order. AOV is a key indicator for a company's sales effectiveness.

Sales and Profit Analysis
This section contains various charts that break down sales and profit data.

Profit by Month: This column chart displays the monthly profit trend. Positive bars indicate months with a profit, while negative bars (like May and June) show months with a loss. This is excellent for identifying seasonal trends or periods of poor performance.

Sum of Amount by State: This bar chart visualizes total sales revenue broken down by state, with Maharashtra being the top-performing state. This helps identify key markets and geographical sales distribution.

Sum of Quantity by Category: This donut chart shows the distribution of items sold across different product categories. Clothing accounts for the largest share (63%), followed by Electronics (21%) and Furniture (17%). This helps in understanding which product categories are most popular.

Sum of Amount by Customer Name: This bar chart ranks the top customers by their total purchase amount. Hunivansh is shown as the highest-spending customer, which is useful for identifying and rewarding valuable customers.

Sum of Quantity by Payment Mode: This donut chart breaks down sales volume by the payment method used. COD (Cash on Delivery) is the most common payment mode (44%), followed by UPI (21%) and Debit Card (13%). This insight can help optimize payment options and understand customer preferences.

Sum of Profit by Sub-Category: This bar chart shows the profitability of different product sub-categories. Printers and Bookcases are the most profitable, while Tables are the least profitable. This is crucial for making decisions about product inventory and marketing strategies.

Interactive Filters
The dashboard also includes interactive filters to allow for more specific data analysis.

Quarter Filter (Qtr 1, Qtr 2, Qtr 3, Qtr 4): Users can filter the entire dashboard by quarter to analyze performance for a specific three-month period. The "Select All" button resets the filter to show data for the entire year.

Global Filter: There's a dropdown menu (currently showing "All") which likely allows for filtering by other dimensions, such as a specific year, region, or product.

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making, offering clear insights into business performance across sales, profitability, and customer behavior. It's a great example of a well-designed and effective business intelligence visualization.
